;;;# Parsing Type Specifications
;;;
;;; Type specifications are of the form (type {args}*). The
;;; type parser can specify how its arguments should look like
;;; through a lambda list.
;;;
;;; "type" is a shortcut for "(type)", ie, no args were specified.
;;;
;;; Examples of such types: boolean, (boolean), (boolean :int)
;;; If the boolean type parser specifies the lambda list:
;;; &optional (base-type :int), then all of the above three
;;; type specs would be parsed to an identical type.
;;;
;;; Type parsers, defined with DEFINE-TYPE-SPEC-PARSER should
;;; return a subtype of the foreign-type class.
