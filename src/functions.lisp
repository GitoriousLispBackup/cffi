;;;# Calling Foreign Functions
;;;
;;; FOREIGN-FUNCALL is the main primitive for calling foreign
;;; functions.  It converts each argument based on the installed
;;; translators for its type, then passes the resulting list to
;;; CFFI-SYS:%FOREIGN-FUNCALL.
;;;
;;; For implementation-specific reasons, DEFCFUN doesn't use
;;; FOREIGN-FUNCALL directly and might use something else
;;; (passed to TRANSLATE-OBJECTS as the CALL argument) instead
;;; of CFFI-SYS:%FOREIGN-FUNCALL to call the foreign-function.
